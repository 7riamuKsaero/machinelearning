The Writer's Journey by Christopher Vogler is divided into three parts. The first part introduces the concept of the Hero's Journey, a universal pattern of storytelling that can be found in myths, legends, fairy tales, and movies. The Hero's Journey consists of 12 stages that the hero goes through in his or her quest, from the ordinary world to the special world and back. The stages are:

1. The Ordinary World: The hero's normal life before the adventure begins.
2. The Call to Adventure: The hero receives a challenge or a problem that disrupts his or her ordinary world.
3. Refusal of the Call: The hero hesitates or rejects the call due to fear or doubt.
4. Meeting with the Mentor: The hero meets a wise or helpful figure who provides guidance or advice.
5. Crossing the Threshold: The hero leaves the ordinary world and enters the special world of the adventure.
6. Tests, Allies, Enemies: The hero faces various challenges and meets friends and foes in the special world.
7. Approach to the Inmost Cave: The hero prepares for the most difficult or dangerous part of the journey.
8. The Ordeal: The hero faces a life-or-death crisis that tests his or her courage and skills.
9. The Reward: The hero survives the ordeal and obtains a treasure or a benefit.
10. The Road Back: The hero decides to return to the ordinary world with the reward.
11. The Resurrection: The hero faces a final test or a showdown with the main enemy.
12. Return with Elixir: The hero returns to the ordinary world with the reward and shares it with others.

- The Mentor: The teacher or guide who helps the hero along the way.
- The Threshold Guardian: The obstacle or enemy who blocks the hero's path.
- The Herald: The messenger or catalyst who announces the call to adventure.
- The Shapeshifter: The character who changes appearance or allegiance.
- The Shadow: The dark side of the hero or the main antagonist.
- The Ally: The friend or helper who supports the hero.
- The Trickster: The character who provides comic relief or challenges the status quo.

It covers topics such as theme, structure, plot points, character arcs, dialogue, style, and revision. It also includes some examples of successful stories that follow the Hero's Journey, such as Star Wars, The Wizard of Oz, Titanic, The Lion King, and more.
